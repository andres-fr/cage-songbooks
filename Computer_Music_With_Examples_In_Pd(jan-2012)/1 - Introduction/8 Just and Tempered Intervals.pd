#X text 553 233 Fraction;
#X text 46 365 The interval measure in cents has the Equal Temperament
as its basis. It's useful because we are used to this system \, and
we can compare the interval differences to this system.;
#X text 46 37 Just Intervals belong to just Intonation Systems \, and
are rational numbers. They are represented by fractions of whole numbers.
They are \, for instance \, found in the relationship of a harmonic
series \, because that is a sequence of whole numbers!;
#X text 46 125 Just Intonation is contrast to Equal Temperament \,
which have irrational numbers. For example \, we saw that the Tritone
is square root of 2 Pd will tell us that this number is 1.41421 \,
but the truth is that the decimal places never ends or repeats \, so
we can't actually represent it by a "ratio" \, or a fraction of whole
numbers!;
#X text 556 302 ratio;
#X text 47 227 Nevertheless \, as an approximation - and also for the
sake of simplicity and not being too theoretically rigorous - we can
consider 1.41421 as a ratio \, although we know it is an irrational
number.;
#X text 47 300 As mentioned before \, we're implying a ratio to "1".
Thus \, any number can be called a ratio and represent a musical interval!
;
#X text 48 424 A Just Intonation Fifth has the ratio of 3/2 \, or 1
\, 5 It corresponds to the proportion of the third to the second harmonic.
To compare this Fifth to the Equal Temperament Fifth \, lets check
both values in cents.;
#X text 516 35 We have in mind that the Equal Temperament Fifth is
7 Semitones wide. Since each semitone has 100 cents \, this Fifth has
700 cents.;
#X text 518 90 We also know the formula to convert to cents \, given
before:;
#X obj 630 321 expr (log($f1)/log(2))*1200;
#X obj 630 381 expr pow(2 \, $f1/1200);

#X text 850 161 cents/1200;
#X text 705 115 cents = Log2(ratio) * 1200;
#X text 777 171 ratio = 2;
#X text 555 442 We see that the just Fifth is approximately 2 cents
wider than the tempered Fifth. You can enter other fractions to check
the value of other Just INtervals in cents.;
